Task 1

The infrastructural specifics

1- For every additional element, why you are adding it- To map the specific IP addresses through the Domain Name System (DNS). This mapping enables users to access websites and online resources by typing in familiar domain names rather than numerical IP addresses, which are less intuitive and more prone to errors when entered manually.

2- What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works- The HAProxy load balancer is configured with the R Robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm works by using each server behind the load balancer in turns, and according to their weights. Also, it is the smoothest and most fair algorithm as the serversâ€™ processing time stays equally distributed. As a dynamic algorithm, R Robin allows server weights to be adjusted on the go.

3- Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both.


The HAProxy load-balancer enables an Active-Passive setup rather than an Active-Active setup.


i) In an Active-Active setup, the load balancer distributes workloads across all nodes in order to prevent any single node from getting overloaded. Because there are more nodes available to serve, there will also be a marked improvement in throughput and response times.

ii) In Active-Passive setup, not all nodes are going to be active i.e capable of receiving workloads at all times.
In the case of two nodes, for example, if the first node is already active, the second node must be passive or on standby. The second or the next passive node can become an active node if the preceding node is inactive.

4- How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works- A Primary-Replica setup configures one server to act as the Primary server and the other server to act as a Replica of the Primary server. The Primary server is capable of performing read/write requests whilst the Replica server is only capable of performing read requests. Data is synchronized between the Primary and Replica servers whenever the Primary server executes a write operation.

5- What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application- The Primary node is responsible for all the write operations the site needs while the Replica node is capable of processing read operations, which decreases the read traffic to the Primary node.

Infrastructural issues.


1- Where are SPOF- If the Primary MySQL database server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site including adding or removing users. The server containing the load balancer and the application server connecting to the primary database server are also SPOFs.


2- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)- The data conveyed over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate so hackers can spy on the network. There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server.


3- No monitoring- There is no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
